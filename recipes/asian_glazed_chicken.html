        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>For my final recipe, I decided to go with my daughters' favorite dinner (that I cook at least). According to them, it is a deliciously crispy recipe that others should try cooking!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8 skinless, boneless chicken thighs</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of rice vinegar</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons of honey</li>
            <li>1/3 cup of soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 of taosted Asian sesame oil</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons of Asian chili garlic sauce</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons of minced garlic</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <p><li>Whisk together honey, vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil, chili garlic sauce, garlic, and salt in a bowl. Transfer marinade into a ziplock bag, followed by chicken thighs. Squeeze air out of the bag and seal tightly. Shake the bag a few times and the set bag in the refrigerator for an hour, turning the bag over at least once to well coat both sides of the chicken.</li></p>
            <p><li>Preheat oven to 425°F.</li></p>
            <p><li>Remove the chicken from the marinade bag and place into a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li></p>
            <p><li>Bake for 30 minutes, or until an instant-read thermometer reads 165°F. Let fully-cooked chicken stand for 5 to 10 minutes before plating with rice or your desired choice of sides!</li></p>
        </ol>
