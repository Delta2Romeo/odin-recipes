    <img src="../images/TJs waffles.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Unlike my cinnamon rolls recipe page, this process will very simple. So simple, in fact, that I will not bother giving an ingredients list because all you must do is buy a box from you nearest Trader Joe's!</p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <p><li>Go to your local Trader Joe's and purchase a box of their belgian waffles.</li></p>
        <p><li>Once you are back home, follow the heating instructions on the box. I use my airfryer, set to bake at 400Â°F for 6 minutes.</li></p>
        <p><li>That is it! Enjoy the waffles alone or with any other breakfast items that you prefer.</li></p>
    </ol>
